## Lyrics

```
people make me sway into my morbid place
on the edge of a blade sliced off 
from my beaten path to the end
i told myself don't go that's okay
it's time to get back

With Empty words inside the smoke they disintegrate
Take away all of the pain with an early grave,
Slowly fade through the brighter days I'll be at the gates
Don't wait for the weeks I'm gone
I'm a mess i get worse as the time goes on
Pass by to the great unknown been trash let go goodnight won't mourn

make your time


```
