## Lyrics

```
people make me sway into my morbid place
on the edge of the blade marks of blood
sliced off from my beaten path to the end
i told myself don't go so up coz that's okay
it's time to get it back

xxxxxxx feigning's 
been in the right
stacking on life's truth scarce
so make it count 
hope it better arrived

say can't take it 
any day focus on the touchdown 
better on countdown
so lone so long

people make me sway into my morbid place
on the edge of a blade marks of blood
sliced off from my beaten path to the end
i told myself don't go so up coz that's okay
it's time to get it back

give it back
give it back
give it back
give it back
give it back
give it back

people make me sway into middle of my morbid place
on the edge of a blade marks of blood
sliced off from my beaten path to the end
i told myself don't go so up coz that's okay
it's time to get it back and I never will be blamed
